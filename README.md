# Password Generator

## Description

This webpage was created to allow a user to generate a random password. A user just has to answer some prompts to confirm what password criteria they would like in their password. The criteria can include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. A user can also tell the generator how long they want the password to be. In writing the JavaScript for this I gained a better understanding of conditional statements, iteration, and methods.
